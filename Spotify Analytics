#I used a Spotify Data from Kaggle for this project.

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)


#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv file into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and valence by artist and track.
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(valence)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#Then, I determined which artists had the most songs in the top 50.
SELECT 
distinct artist_name
, count(id) as total_songs 
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY total_songs desc
LIMIT 5
