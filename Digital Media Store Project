#I used the "chinook" media store dataset below for this project.

#Then I double-clicked the unzipped file to open in SQLite.

#Next, I explored the data using the following questions and SQL.

#What are the total sales for Germany?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE BillingCountry = "Germany"


#Show the customers from Germany.

SELECT 
    FirstName, 
    LastName, 
    Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Germany"


#Show all tracks with their album name, and genre.

SELECT 
    t.Name AS 'Track Name', 
    a.Title AS 'Album Title',
    g.Name AS 'Genre'  
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.Albums a 
on a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Genres g
on g.GenreId = t.GenreId


#How many tracks are in the jazz genre?

SELECT distinct count(trackId)
FROM chinook.tracks Tracks
LEFT JOIN chinook.genres Genres
ON tracks.GenreId=Genres.GenreId
WHERE Genres.GenreId=2


#Which Sales Support Agents made the least amount of money?
SELECT 
    Emp.FirstName, 
    Emp.LastName,
    SUM(Inv.Total) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees Emp

JOIN chinook.Customers Cus 
ON Cus.SupportRepId = Emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = Cus.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY Emp.FirstName
ORDER BY SUM(Inv.Total) ASC LIMIT 1;


#Which employees were hired in 2002?
SELECT 
    FirstName, 
    LastName,
    HireDate
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE HireDate like '2002%'
